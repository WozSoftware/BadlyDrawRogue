# Code of Conduct 

This project is a pure meritocracy. You will be valued based on contribution alone. Political views or sexuality do not matter in the slightest, only what you bring to the table.  

Code talks and BS walks. If you want to take part understand: 

* Your personal life or political beliefs have no place in the project space. 
* IT has a wide spectrum of neurodiversity. Some do not understand or read emotions as well as others or word things in ways you might not like. Take this into account. 
* If you reject code, make it about the code and not the person. No hostility. 
* If your code is criticized accept it, fix it and move on. 
* The project lead(s) have the final say. 

Anything in the project space not to do with the project, the code or the technology will not be tolerated and dealt with!
